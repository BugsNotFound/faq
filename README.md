## This is a WIP FAQ for Tusky | Frequently asked questions about the Tusky Mastodon client

Which will include some experimentation with tools to write this FAQ and sync it with GitHub, by @mal0ki (current tool is StackEdit).

## FAQ
**Question:** When will Tusky be available on F-Droid?

**Answer:** F-Droid works differently than Amazon Appstore or Google Play. We as the developers do not upload anything, F-Droid builds the app from source once we tag a release in our code repository. This is super awesome because you are guaranteed to get the exact code from our repo, but also takes some time on their side.

##
**Q:** Why doesn't Tusky support push notifications?

**A:** Pushing to devices would require us to use proprietary Google libraries and to run a relay server. Since we want Tusky to be pure FOSS (free and open-source software) and don't want to send any data to Google we decided not to implement push notifications at this time. We are researching other possibilities to make notifications faster though.
##

**Q:** Will my filters import from my instance?

**A:** They will, but not until after version 3. You can use Tuskys tab filters in the meantime.
##

**Q:** I want to help out, what can I do?

**A:** You can either reach out to us directly, or check out the [Github](https://github.com/tuskyapp/Tusky) directly.
##

 **Q:** Can I try out the beta? 

 **A:** You can sign up for the [Google Play beta, via this link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky)
##

**Q:** What about Nightly releases?

**A:** The Tusky nightly is [available on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky.test) as well. On F-Droid, [add this repo](https://releases.nailyk.fr/repo/).
##

**Q:** The likes and boosts aren't displaying the same numbers as on the web?

**A:** This is not a Tusky bug, it's because boosts and likes do not federate perfectly. I.e., if you and the user whom you see this on, are not on the same server you will see different numbers on Tusky and on their message on the web.
