## FAQ
**Q:** When will Tusky be avaialble on F-droid?
**A:** Fdroid works differently than Amazon Appstore or Google Play. We as the developers do not upload anything, Fdroid builds the app from source once we tag a release in our code repository. This is super awesome because you are guaranteed to get the exact code from our repo, but also takes some time on their side.
