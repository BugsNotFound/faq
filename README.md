## This is a WIP FAQ for Tusky | Frequently asked questions about the Tusky Mastodon client

Which will include some experimentation with tools to write this FAQ and sync it with GitHub, by @mal0ki (current tool is StackEdit).

## FAQ
**Q:** When will Tusky be avaialble on F-droid?
**A:** Fdroid works differently than Amazon Appstore or Google Play. We as the developers do not upload anything, Fdroid builds the app from source once we tag a release in our code repository. This is super awesome because you are guaranteed to get the exact code from our repo, but also takes some time on their side.


**Q:** Why doesn't Tusky support push notifications?
**A:** Pushing to devices would require us to use proprietary Google libraries and to run a relay server. Since we want Tusky to be pure FOSS (free and open-source software) and don't want to send any data to Google we decided not to implement push notifications at this time. We are researching other possibilities to make notifications faster though.


**Q:** Will my filters import from my instance?
**A:** They will, but not until after v3
